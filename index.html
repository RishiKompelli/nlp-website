      <h3>Research question</h3>
      <p>How can natural language processing (NLP) techniques be optimized to create effective therapeutic dialogues that significantly reduce anxiety in teenagers, and how do these AI-generated dialogues compare to those created by human therapists in terms of engagement, empathy, and anxiety reduction outcomes?      </p>

      <h3>Rationale</h3>
      <p>Mental health is important because it affects every aspect of our lives. Many teenagers experience mental health issues due to a combination of factors such as academic pressure, social media influence, and hormonal changes, yet they often cannot seek help due to stigma, lack of resources, and the high cost of professional therapy. This leaves many struggling in silence, without the support they need to manage their mental health effectively. This is important because it seeks to overcome the barriers of stigma, cost, and resource availability by providing an affordable and effective alternative to traditional therapy.</p>

      <h3>Methodology</h3>
      <p>In this project, we will combine multiple small public datasets into one large dataset to analyze teenage mental health issues. After standardizing and eaning the data, we'll select and fine-tune a pre-trained model to predict mental health outcomes. We'll train and evaluate the model, ensuring accuracy and fairness. Our analysis will identify key factors and barriers to seeking help, and we'll visualize our findings for clear interpretation. Throughout the project, we'll maintain data privacy and address any biases. Finally, we'll compile our results into create an app that improves mental health support for teenagers.</p>
